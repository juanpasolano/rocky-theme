##Customise with LESS

The theme provides an easy way to customaze the colors and fonts of the template.

To change the colors open the file ```assets/css/variables.less``` and change those variables you see there.

```
//Background Color
@bgColor:#fcfcfc;

//This is the primary color of the theme: used for links and icons and other decorations
@mainColor: #cd173a;

//Color of texts
@paragraphColor:  lighten(black, 60%);

//Color of headers
@headersColor:lighten(black, 20%);

//Main Font for headers
@mainFont: 'Roboto Slab';

//Font for paragraphs and other secondary texts
@secondaryFont: 'Roboto';
```

You can see the last two variables are for fonts. If you want to change the fonts open the file ```assets/css/fonts.less``` and copy the link from google fonts and then change the name of the variable.

You can then compile the file ```assets/css/styles.less``` and you will have a new palette and font for your amazing blog.

##Entypo icons and google fonts
Rocky uses the large, beautiful and easy to use gallery of [entypo icons](http://entypo.com/).
It also uses some Google fonts which you can easily customize.
